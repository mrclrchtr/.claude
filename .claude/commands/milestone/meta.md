1. Read `@docs/milestones/MILESTONE_MANAGER.md`
2. List all milestones in `@docs/milestones/`
3. Update `@docs/milestones/MILESTONE_MANAGER.md` by:
    - adding new milestones to the end of the list in this format:
      ```markdown
      i. [@docs/tasks/MX_DESCRIPTION.md](MX_DESCRIPTION.md) - [ ]
      ```
      where `i` is the number of the milestones in the list and `MX_DESCRIPTION` is the milestone name.
    - removing milestones, marked as `DONE` or no longer existing as file.

There should also be a legend with the possible values for the status:

   ```markdown
   ## Milestone Status Legend

- [ ] Not started
- [WIP] In progress
- [DONE] Completed
- [BLOCKED] Blocked/Waiting
- [CANCELLED] Cancelled
   ```
