# Optimize Command

## Context

- Command path: $ARGUMENTS
- Command content: @$ARGUMENTS
- Existing commands: !`fd . .claude/commands -e md --type f 2>/dev/null || find .claude/commands -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null`

## Task

Analyze the command at $ARGUMENTS to determine if optimization would provide meaningful value.

### What Optimization Actually Means

Optimization = Making commands MORE EFFECTIVE through:
1. **Functionality** (Priority 1) - Fix broken or failing parts
2. **Efficiency** (Priority 2) - Reduce wasted resources (unnecessary API calls, redundant operations)
3. **Clarity** (Priority 3) - Fix genuinely confusing instructions
4. **Conciseness** (Priority 4) - Remove TRUE redundancy (not just wordiness)

### üéØ Core Principle: Preserve Command Purpose

**Before optimizing:** Understand what the command returns (list vs count, content vs summary)

**Never break purpose by:**
- Converting listings to counts when files need processing (`ls files` ‚Üí `wc -l`)
- Replacing detailed output with summaries when details are required
- Removing context that enables the command's goal

**Example:** `git ls-files '*.md'` returns paths for analysis. Don't change to `| wc -l` (just a count).

### Optimization Decision Tree

Ask these questions IN ORDER:
1. Is something broken or failing? ‚Üí YES: Fix it (HIGH VALUE)
   - *Example: Broken bash command, missing error handling*
2. Is something >2x inefficient? ‚Üí YES: Improve it (HIGH VALUE)
   - *Example: 4 separate API calls that could be 1, using `find` instead of `fd`*
3. Are instructions genuinely unclear? ‚Üí YES: Clarify (MEDIUM VALUE)
   - *Example: "Do the thing" vs "Run npm test to validate changes"*
4. Is there TRUE redundancy (same info repeated)? ‚Üí YES: Remove it (LOW VALUE)
   - *Example: Same bash command appears 3 times, identical instructions in 2 sections*
5. Would changes improve effectiveness by >20%? ‚Üí YES: Proceed (MEDIUM VALUE)
6. **None of the above? ‚Üí STOP: Output "Command analysis complete. No significant improvements needed."**

**Examples of what NOT to optimize:**
- Removing helpful examples = Reduces effectiveness (DON'T DO)
- Rewording for style preferences = 0% improvement (DON'T DO)

### When NOT to Optimize
- Command works correctly
- Word count is within 20% of typical range
- Changes would be mostly stylistic
- This is the 2nd or 3rd optimization pass
- Removing content would reduce helpfulness

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Over-Optimization Warning Signs
If you find yourself:
- Doing mostly rewording without functional changes
- Unable to identify specific broken functionality
- Focusing on word count rather than problems
- Optimizing the same command repeatedly
- Struggling to justify the changes

**STOP** - The command doesn't need optimization.

Context: @.claude/docs/context.md for comprehensive git commands.

### Optimization Process

1. **Rev the engine (self-critique)**:
   - State initial optimization plan
   - Challenge assumptions: "Am I about to remove something critical?"
   - Consider alternatives: "Is there a simpler optimization approach?"
   - Identify risks: "What could break if I remove this?"
   - Refine approach based on internal review

2. **Analyze current command**:
   - Think about the purpose of the command and keep this in mind for every decision in the optimization process
   - **STEP 1**: Use Read tool on each `@` reference in the command
   - **STEP 2**: Document what each reference provides (scope, purpose, unique content)
   - **STEP 3**: Only after reading ALL references, identify true redundancies
   - Review context gathering (combine bash commands, remove duplicates)
   - Evaluate task clarity and word count

3. **Assess if optimization provides MEANINGFUL value**:
   
   **Calculate improvement value:**
   - Fixing broken functionality = 100% improvement
   - Reducing API calls by half = 50% improvement  
   - Improving unclear instructions = 20-30% improvement
   - Removing redundancy = 10-15% improvement
   - Style/wording changes = <5% improvement (DON'T DO)
   
   **Decision points:**
   - >20% total improvement ‚Üí Proceed with optimization
   - 10-20% improvement ‚Üí Report minor issues but recommend keeping as-is
   - <10% improvement ‚Üí Output: "Command is effective. No optimization warranted."
   
   **Include in your response:**
   - Current word count and typical range for command type
   - Specific issues found (if any) with line numbers
   - Estimated improvement percentage

4. **Apply optimizations**:
   - Use glob patterns: `src/components/*.js` instead of listing files
   - Remove politeness: "Analyze" not "Please analyze"
   - Preserve error handling and user guidance
   - Keep documentation references unless you can cite specific overlapping content from your analysis

5. **Model selection**:
   - do not add model to command, inherit from main thread

6. **Sub-agent references**:
   - Use sub-agent references if applicable.
   - Request specific subagents by mentioning them:
     ```
     >    Use the test-runner subagent to fix failing tests
     >    Have the code-reviewer subagent look at my recent changes
     ```
   - See available agents in @.claude/agents directory.

7. **Bash command handling**:
   - Test and optimize each bash command that the command executes
   - Use `@.claude/docs/context.md` as reference for context gathering patterns
   - Apply context.md principles:
     * Use modern tools (fd, rg, eza) for 3-10x faster execution
     * Replace find‚Üífd, grep‚Üírg, ls‚Üíeza
     * Always use --no-pager for git commands
     * Pre-assess scope before full execution (e.g., `git diff --stat` before full diff)
     * Filter before limiting depth (use excludes/ignore-globs first)
     * Prefer machine-readable formats (--porcelain) over human-readable
     * **Use simple pipes** for counting/filtering (`| wc -l`, `| grep pattern`)
     * **Remove artificial limits by default** - Delete head/tail/depth limits unless genuinely needed
       - Remove: `git log -5` ‚Üí `git log --oneline` (if checking full history)
       - Remove: `rg "TODO" | head -10` ‚Üí `rg "TODO" | wc -l` (simple pipe for counting)
       - Keep: Large unbounded operations that need sampling

8. **Script handling**:
   - Check script contents
   - Keep initialization scripts that create templates
   - Preserve complex logic in scripts
   - Create scripts if applicable

9. **Error patterns to preserve**:
   ```markdown
   # Keep specific error messages
   If missing, show error: "Error: File not found at path" and exit
   
   # Keep recovery guidance  
   If fails: "Error: [summary]. Try: npm cache clean --force"
   ```

10. **Reference analysis requirement**:
   - **You MUST use Read tool on each @ reference before optimization**
   - Document each reference's unique contribution
   - Only remove if you can quote the redundant sections
   - Default to keeping references when unsure

### Optimization Value Metrics

**Always Optimize:**
- Broken bash commands or API calls
- Missing critical error handling
- Duplicate operations (same data gathered twice)
- Inefficient tools providing >2x speedup (find‚Üífd, grep‚Üírg)

**Consider Optimizing (if >20% improvement):**
- Genuinely unclear instructions
- TRUE redundancy (not just verbose explanations)
- Significantly exceeds typical word count (>50% over)

**Never Optimize:**
- Working commands with <10% potential improvement
- Style preferences with no functional impact
- Commands already optimized once (unless newly broken)
- Removing examples that aid understanding

**Word Count Ranges (FLEXIBLE GUIDELINES with intentional overlap):**
- Simple commands: 100-300 words (status checks, single actions)
- Standard commands: 200-600 words (most development tasks)
- Process commands: 500-1000 words (analyze, refactor, multi-step)
- Meta/Teaching commands: 700-1200 words (optimize, guide, teach)

*Note: Ranges overlap because command complexity varies. A 400-word command could be standard (if complex) or process (if simple). Focus on effectiveness, not exact categorization.*

### Output Format

Update the command specification with:
1. Updated frontmatter (minimal required fields)
2. Efficient context gathering
3. Clear, direct task description and sub-agent usage, if applicable
4. Preserved error handling
5. Report: improvements made, elements preserved, word count change
6. **Reference analysis**: List each @ reference examined and why it was kept/removed
