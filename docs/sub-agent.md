# Claude Code Subagents - Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

**Subagents** are specialized AI assistants within Claude Code that handle specific types of tasks with their own dedicated context windows, custom system prompts, and configurable tool access. They represent a paradigm shift towards **agent-first design**, where AI agents are treated as first-class participants in creation, iteration, and scaling.

Subagents are pre-configured AI personalities that operate independently from the main Claude Code conversation, featuring specific expertise areas, isolated context windows, configurable tool access, and custom system prompts that guide behavior and approach.

### Evolution of Subagent Usage

Subagent usage in Claude Code has evolved from manual orchestration to intelligent automation ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/sub-agents/)):

1. **Manual Sub-agents**: The original approach using the Task tool for explicit parallel processing
2. **Custom Agents**: Specialized agents with isolated contexts and automatic activation
3. **Agent Engineering**: The current paradigm focusing on token efficiency, model optimization, and community sharing ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/agent-engineering/))

## Core Architecture & Philosophy

### Architecture Principles

- **Parallel Task Delegation**: Subagents operate like programming threads, performing independent operations simultaneously for improved execution efficiency. "Like programming with threads, explicit orchestration of which steps get delegated to sub-agents yields the best results" ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/task-agent-tools/))
- **Explicit Orchestration**: The main agent coordinates subagent activities with careful task delegation and explicit instructions. Claude uses Task agents cautiously unless you provide detailed delegation instructions
- **Context Isolation**: Each subagent maintains its own context window, preventing pollution and enabling focused problem-solving
- **Pattern Extension**: Beyond simple task execution, subagents recognize and creatively extend patterns to generate new value

### Agent-First Philosophy

Subagents embody the agent-first design philosophy by ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/agent-first-design/)):
- Moving beyond human task automation to enabling agents as creative partners
- Building modular, templatable experiences that agents can systematically vary
- Enabling mass customization and personalization at scale without linear resource scaling
- Creating systems where agents can generate infinite variations from finite foundations
- Identifying fundamental product patterns that AI agents can meaningfully extend, customize, and scale for individual users

### Operational Architecture

**Main Agent:**
- Interactive but can have higher latency
- Orchestrates and coordinates sub-agent activities
- Manages overall workflow and task completion
- Maintains primary context window

**Sub-Agents:**
- Execute tasks independently with dedicated context windows
- Handle file operations, code searches, and bash commands
- Primarily used for read/search operations for safety
- Results consume space in the main agent's context

## Configuration & Setup

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Open the subagents interface**: Run `/agents`
2. **Select 'Create New Agent'**: Choose project-level or user-level subagent
3. **Define the subagent**:
   - Generate with Claude first, then customize (recommended approach)
   - Describe the subagent in detail and when it should be used
   - Select tools to grant access to (or leave blank to inherit all tools)
   - Edit system prompt in your preferred editor by pressing `e`
4. **Save and use**: Subagent becomes available automatically or via explicit invocation

### File Locations & Priority

| Type | Location | Scope | Priority |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Project subagents** | `.claude/agents/` | Available in current project | Highest |
| **User subagents** | `~/.claude/agents/` | Available across all projects | Lower |

*Note: Project-level subagents take precedence over user-level subagents when names conflict.*

### Configuration Format

Subagents are defined as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
model: claude-sonnet-4-0  # Optional - specify Claude model
---

Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.
```

### Configuration Fields

- **`name`** (Required): Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens
- **`description`** (Required): Natural language description of the subagent's purpose. Include phrases like "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" for more proactive use ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/custom-agents/))
- **`tools`** (Optional): Comma-separated list of specific tools. If omitted, inherits all tools from the main thread
- **`model`** (Optional): Specify which Claude model the agent should use (sonnet, opus, or haiku)

### Tool Configuration Options

1. **Omit the `tools` field**: Inherit all tools from main thread (default), including MCP tools
2. **Specify individual tools**: Comma-separated list for granular control

## Usage Methods & Examples

### Automatic Delegation

Claude Code proactively delegates tasks based on:
- Task description in your request
- The `description` field in subagent configurations
- Current context and available tools

This automatic delegation represents a form of "Tool SEO" - configuring your agent to be promptly utilized by Claude ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/custom-agents/)). If you need to improve reliability:
- Update your agent's name for clarity
- Refine the description field with action-oriented language
- Include "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" in descriptions
- Test and iterate based on invocation patterns

### Explicit Invocation

Request specific subagents by mentioning them:
```
> Use the test-runner subagent to fix failing tests
> Have the code-reviewer subagent look at my recent changes
> Ask the debugger subagent to investigate this error
```

**Explicit Parallel Control** ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/sub-agent-tactics/)):
```
> Use 3 sub-agents to handle this task
> Create a sub-agent for each file that needs updating
```

### Example Subagents

**Tools**: Bash, Read, Write
**Key Features**: Optimized SQL queries, BigQuery CLI tools, data-driven recommendations

## Advanced Patterns & Workflows

### Parallel Processing & Task Delegation

#### Efficient Parallel Workflows

1. **Explicit Step Definition**: Provide detailed, unambiguous steps for each delegated task
2. **Task Grouping**: Group related tasks together to optimize token costs
3. **Clear Instructions**: Use specific instructions to minimize ambiguity and rework

#### The 7-Parallel-Task Method

For maximum efficiency when dealing with multiple related tasks ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/task-agent-tools/)):

1. **Identify Parallelizable Tasks**: Find operations that don't depend on each other
2. **Group by Resource Type**: Batch similar operations (file reads, searches, etc.) to improve token efficiency
3. **Launch Up to 7 Tasks Simultaneously**: This represents the optimal balance between parallel processing and context management
4. **Explicit Orchestration**: Provide detailed delegation instructions for each parallel task
5. **Consolidate Results**: Gather outputs and proceed with sequential dependencies
6. **Verify Integration**: Run tests, linting, and builds after parallel completion
7. **Iterate Based on Results**: Use findings to inform next parallel batch

**Key Principle**: "Like programming with threads, explicit orchestration of which steps get delegated to sub-agents yields the best results."

**Token Optimization Strategy**: Strip comments when reading code for analysis, minimize context transfer between agents, and batch similar operations to prevent over-splitting

#### Structured Workflow Example

```markdown
## Parallel Feature Implementation Workflow
1. Create main component file
2. Create component styles/CSS (parallel)
3. Create test files (parallel)
4. Update imports and exports (parallel)
5. Run tests and fix issues (sequential)
```

#### Orchestration Best Practices

- **Strip Comments**: When reading files for analysis to reduce token usage
- **Minimize Context Transfer**: Only pass essential information between agents
- **Strategic Delegation**: Delegate tasks that don't require constant human intervention
- **Batch Similar Operations**: Combine small configuration updates to prevent over-splitting

### Chaining Subagents

For complex workflows, chain multiple subagents:
```
> First use the code-analyzer subagent to find performance issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
```

### Task Type Analysis for Subagent Selection

([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/sub-agent-tactics/))

#### Perfect Parallelizable Tasks
Tasks ideal for immediate sub-agent parallelization:
- **Non-destructive operations**: Research, analysis, comparison matrices
- **Isolated workflows**: Each agent works independently without interference
- **Consolidatable outputs**: Results can be merged by the main agent

*Example*: "Research 8 different MCPs and write pros/cons for each" - perfect for parallel sub-agents as they don't interfere with each other or the codebase.

#### The Consolidation Strategy
For tasks requiring coordination:
1. **Enter Plan Mode** for non-destructive execution
2. **Deploy parallel sub-agents** for different perspectives (redundancy, security, factuality, time-complexity)
3. **Consolidate suggestions** in the main agent
4. **Clear context if needed** to action suggestions from a fresh start

#### Developing an Itch for Parallelism
"Day by day, week by week I find myself learning to utilise sub-agents in more and more creative ways!" Start with obvious parallel tasks, then progressively identify more opportunities for parallelization.

### Split-Role Sub-Agents Pattern

Split-role sub-agents enable multiple specialized agent perspectives to analyze a single task simultaneously, providing comprehensive insights through parallel analysis ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/split-role-sub-agents/)).

This mechanic delivers exceptional value by maximizing Claude Sonnet's capabilities through strategic orchestration. Rather than reaching for the 5x more expensive Opus model, split role sub-agents combined with ultrathink unlock sophisticated analysis at Sonnet pricing.

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Activate Plan Mode** for safe exploration and experimentation
2. **Enable ultrathink** for enhanced reasoning capabilities
3. **Define specific, non-overlapping role perspectives** that naturally gravitate toward different tools
4. **Launch sub-agents to analyze tasks concurrently** using their specialized approaches
5. **Consolidate findings from all perspectives** for comprehensive analysis

#### Common Role Divisions

**Code Review Roles:**
- Factual Analyst: Objective code correctness
- Senior Engineer: Architectural decisions and best practices
- Security Expert: Vulnerability identification
- Consistency Reviewer: Code style and pattern adherence
- Redundancy Checker: Duplicate or unnecessary code

**User Experience Roles:**
- Creative Designer: Innovative design solutions
- Novice User: Accessibility and ease-of-use
- Marketing Specialist: User engagement and conversion
- SEO Expert: Search optimization and discoverability

**Documentation Roles:**
- Technical Accuracy Checker: Information correctness
- Beginner Accessibility Reviewer: Clarity for new users
- Content Clarity Specialist: Overall readability and structure

#### Benefits of Split-Role Approach
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Surfaces insights that single-agent approaches might miss
- **Cost-Effective Intelligence**: Maximizes capabilities without requiring expensive models
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple perspectives analyzed simultaneously
- **Enhanced Problem-Solving**: Combines diverse expertise for robust solutions

## Performance & Best Practices

### Key Benefits
- **Context Preservation**: Each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation
- **Specialized Expertise**: Fine-tuned with detailed instructions for specific domains
- **Reusability**: Once created, can be used across different projects and shared with teams
- **Flexible Permissions**: Different tool access levels for security and focus
- **Context efficiency**: Agents preserve main context, enabling longer overall sessions
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple tasks completed simultaneously
- **Pattern recognition**: Agents can identify and extend patterns creatively
- **Scalable personalization**: Mass customization without linear resource scaling

### Performance Metrics & Optimization

#### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Token Metrics**: Usage patterns, cumulative costs, efficiency ratios
2. **Speed Metrics**: Response time, processing efficiency, parallel speedup
3. **Quality Metrics**: Output accuracy, relevance score, error rates
4. **User Satisfaction**: Task success rate, rework frequency, subjective quality

#### Cost-Performance Optimization

**Current Pricing Reality (2025)** ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/rev-the-engine/)):
- Premium Models: Claude Opus ($15/$75 per million tokens)
- Mid-Tier Options: Claude Sonnet ($3/$15 per million tokens)
- Budget-Friendly: Claude Haiku ($0.25/$1.25 per million tokens)

**"Rev the Engine" Technique**: Maximize single-model performance before escalating to expensive models:
1. **Round 1**: Use ultrathink + Plan Mode for initial planning
2. **Round 2**: Critique and refine, identify edge cases and redundancies
3. **Round 3**: Final optimization and validation before execution

This approach can push Claude Sonnet far beyond base capabilities, often eliminating the need for the 5x more expensive Opus model.

#### Agent Weight Classifications

Agents are categorized by token usage to optimize performance and cost ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/agent-engineering/)):

| Weight Class | Token Range | Use Cases | Recommended Model | Initialization Impact |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Lightweight** | <3,000 tokens | Simple, frequent tasks like file operations, basic searches | Haiku | Low cost, high composability |
| **Medium-weight** | 10,000-15,000 tokens | Balanced complexity with moderate reasoning | Sonnet | Moderate cost, balanced performance |
| **Heavy** | 25,000+ tokens | Complex analysis, deep reasoning, sophisticated problem-solving | Opus | High cost, workflow bottlenecks |

**Critical Insight**: Lightweight agents are the most composable and effortless to use. They enable fluid orchestration in multi-agent workflows, while heavy agents create bottlenecks due to startup time and token usage

**Strategic Model-Agent Pairing:**

*Conventional Pairings (Starting Points):*
- **Haiku + Lightweight Agents**: Maximize speed for simple operations like commit messages, basic validation
- **Sonnet + Medium Agents**: Balance capability with efficiency for moderate complexity tasks
- **Opus + Heavy Agents**: Leverage maximum intelligence for complex analysis and deep reasoning

*Cross-Experimentation Opportunities ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/agent-engineering/)):*
- **Opus + Lightweight Agent**: Might unlock surprising depth in simple tasks
- **Haiku + Heavy Agent**: Could reveal new efficiency breakthroughs ("Slot Machine" approach)
- **Model Rotation**: Same agent with different models for A/B testing performance

**A.B.E. (Always Be Experimenting) Methodology**: Challenge assumptions about model-task pairings, test unconventional combinations, and share breakthrough discoveries with the community

#### Trade-offs
- **Latency**: Subagents start with clean slate and may add latency while gathering required context
- **Setup overhead**: Initial configuration requires time investment
- **Token initialization**: Each agent invocation has upfront token cost
- **Context window limits**: Results consume space in main agent's context
- **Coordination complexity**: Managing multiple parallel agents requires careful orchestration

#### Optimization Strategies
1. **Agent Selection**: Choose lightweight agents for simple tasks, reserve complex agents for high-value operations
2. **Parallel Processing**: Batch related tasks for concurrent execution, balance parallelism with context constraints. "Think like a CPU scheduler for AI agents" ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/sub-agent-tactics/))
3. **Model Optimization**: Match model capabilities to agent requirements, experiment with unconventional pairings. Build proficiency across the cost spectrum to avoid the "Proficiency Trap" ([Source](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/rev-the-engine/))
4. **Resource Management**: Monitor tool access, prevent context pollution, implement smart routing
5. **Strategic Escalation**: Use "Rev the Engine" technique to maximize single-agent performance before escalating to multi-agent workflows or premium models

### Best Practices & Engineering
